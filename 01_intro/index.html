<h3>Week 1: Final Project Proposal</h3>

<p class="margin">   </p>
At the moment, I have one idea for my final project.

<p class="margin">   </p>
<h4>Idea: The Freedmen's Journal</h4>

<p class="margin">   </p>
As the first manifestation of this concept, The Freedmen’s Journal would be a physical journal that combines real and fabricated accounts of formerly enslaved people during and after the Civil War.

<p class="margin">   </p>
Key features of the journal would include:

<p class="margin">   </p>
Visuals: Each entry will be written in authentic, historically accurate handwriting. Accompanying each letter will be photographs of formerly enslaved people, enhancing the visual and emotional connection.

<p class="margin">   </p>
Audio: The journal will include audio recordings of contemporary African Americans reading the testimonies, bringing the voices of the past to life. This auditory element adds depth to the narrative, allowing listeners to connect emotionally with the stories.

<p class="margin">   </p>
Tactile: The journal itself will be constructed with materials chosen to reflect the physical reality of the time, including textured paper and binding, encouraging a hands-on exploration of the historical content.

<p class="margin">   </p>
This project will demonstrate how history can be more than just a subject to be read—it can be felt, heard, and experienced, bringing the stories of the past into a closer, more human connection with the present.
