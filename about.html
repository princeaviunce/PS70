I took GENED 1080 in the fall of 2021 and had a great time learning
about 3D printing, laser cutting, and basic electronics. For my final
project in that course, I made this lyre:

  <img src="./harp-back.jpeg" alt="the back of a the same lyre" width=25%>
</div>

<p class="caption">(It's about 2 feet tall, for reference.)</p>

I also spend a lot of time outside of class working backstage on
theatrical shows. Specifically, I design, program, and operate the
lighting. Through stage lighting, I've learned about 2D drafting with
CAD software and gotten pretty good at ETC console programming.
